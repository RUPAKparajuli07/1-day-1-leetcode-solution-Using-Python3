# Introduction to My LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Python 3. 

## About Me

I'm Rupak Parajuli, a passionate programmer and problem solver. I enjoy tackling challenging algorithmic problems, and LeetCode provides the perfect platform for honing my skills. Through this repository, I aim to document my journey of solving LeetCode problems, sharing my thought process, and providing clear explanations of my solutions.

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a popular online platform for practicing coding skills through a vast array of algorithmic problems. Solving LeetCode problems not only enhances my problem-solving abilities but also improves my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, each LeetCode problem is neatly organized into its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- A README file providing a description of the problem, my approach to solving it, and the Python implementation.
- A Python script containing my solution code.

Feel free to explore the repository, dive into the problems, and check out my solutions!

## How to Use

1. **Browse Problems**: Navigate through the directory structure to find the LeetCode problem you're interested in.
2. **Read Documentation**: Read the README file within each problem directory to understand the problem description, my approach, and the Python implementation.
3. **Run Code**: Copy the Python code provided in the README or directly run the Python script to see the solution in action.
